### How to Create New Files and Folders
<p>
<p>
This is relatively straight forward if you know where to click.  To start your own folder with your own markdown sheet (one of these, where you can explain what the files are about and the most recent changes), all you have to do is hit "**Create new file**" button at the top of the page.  Then, when you have a new file, you can lable it "**readme**" or whatever you like.  If you type a folder title into the new file name box and then add a slash, it will automatically create the file in a sub-folder (which is pretty sneaky).

There is a page explaining this particular method [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18773598/creating-folders-inside-github-com-repo-without-using-git).

Then, when you want to upload a file, just make sure you are in the folder you want to commit to and click the "**Upload Files**" button (pretty straightforward...)
